Step 1: Parents can raise a TC request from their parent login by selecting Reasons for TC Requests. Step 2: Case 1: The class coordinator, who has approval access, attempts to counsel the parent to withdraw the TC request and close it if the parent is convinced. If the parent is not convinced, the coordinator has to forward the request to the principal of the branch. Case 2: If there is no class coordinator assigned to a class, then the TC request will go to the principal directly. Case 3: If there is a coordinator assigned to the class who doesn't have approval access, then the request will go to the principal directly. Step 3: The principal can further counsel the parent to withdraw the request and close the concern if the parent is convinced.
